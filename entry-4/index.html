0-14 Casual Chat: Music Uploads, Social Media Strategy, Dorm Life, and Weekend Plans
  Conversation Summary  
The Vibe  
Playful, candid, ambitious—balancing  
irreverent humor with sincere drive  
for personal and artistic growth.  
The Dynamic  
The conversation maintains high  
energy with rapid, overlapping  
exchanges and a comfortable rapport.  
It swings between hype-filled  
celebration and grounded reflection,  
especially around art, school,  
and relationships. Moments of  
frustration about logistics (uploads,  
sleep, class) are met with supportive  
advice and practical planning.  
Overall, the sentiment stays  
positive, with friends encouraging  
each other toward creativity,  
confidence, and action.  
The Gist  
It opens with a burst of excitement:  
Speaker 4’s remix of Kanye West’s  
“Cousins” has racked up thousands  
of views on Xvideos, prompting  
chaotic, funny riffs about posting  
art on adult platforms and  
navigating shadow bans and  
formatting across social media.  
Amid the jokes, Speaker 4 shares  
an earnest intention to get music  
onto Spotify via DistroKid, perform  
before year’s end, and keep making  
work that serves the world. The  
group trades updates—website plans,  
skipping class—and drops a shocking  
note about a restraining order  
involving a teacher, before offering  
advice on relationships and  
attachment.  
The focus then softens into  
everyday rhythms: walking to class  
with white noise, dorm noise  
disrupting sleep, and the tension  
between camaraderie and craving  
personal space. Speaker 4 reflects  
on a crush who switched sections  
and wonders if the change is a  
blessing. They float a lighthearted  
solution: a “girl character  
development day” to practice  
social confidence together.  
Finally, the weekend buzz kicks in.  
Speaker 3 pushes for a night out  
and suggests style tweaks, while  
conversation turns to self-image,  
discipline, and deepening an  
artistic practice. Speaker 4  
describes meeting Destiny, who  
validates him and urges structure,  
and he resolves to approach people  
without projecting insecurities.  
The friends muse about  
unpredictability in relationships  
and share frank stories about  
sexual preferences and experiences.  
They wrap with practical notes—  
class locations, recording logistics,  
and BSU involvement—anchoring the  
big talk with tangible next steps.  
Memorable Moments  
Speaker 4: "I have a fucking  
song on Xvideos."  
Speaker 4: "This is a momentous  
occasion. Beautiful. Beautiful.  
What a beautiful life. Wow.  
Look at that."  
Speaker 3: "Bro, upload your  
new song to this, bro. You  
have to."  
Speaker 4: "I love when I can  
make something and I can  
contribute to the world. The  
thing that I made is just in  
the world and it can do what  
it needs to. I don't even  
need to be famous. I just  
want the thing I make to be  
of service to the world in  
the way that I can."  
Speaker 3: "This is why dorm  
life is hard. That's why  
when you have a dorm it's  
so hard to get sleep  
because you have to live  
with other people."  
Speaker 3: "Why limit  
anything out of our lives?"  
Things to Remember  
Speaker 4’s remix of “Cousins”  
by Kanye West has 5,000 views  
on Xvideos.

to Xvideos and post on  
Twitter.
