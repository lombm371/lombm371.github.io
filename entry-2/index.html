  <h1>What's buzzing in the world of Ai</h1>

  <h2>Entry #2 – Friend.com</h2>
<p>Friend.com is an AI startup founded by Avi Schiffmann, known for creating a COVID-19 tracking website. 
    The company has developed a wearable AI companion designed to combat loneliness by providing emotional support. The device, resembling a pendant, 
    is worn around the neck and continuously listens to the user's environment. It connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth and uses the Claude 3.5 language 
    model to offer real-time, personalized interactions. The device can respond to voice prompts and also proactively engage with users based on contextual cues.
Priced at $99, the Friend pendant boasts a 15-hour battery life and comes in 
various colors. It is set to ship in January 2025. The company has already received over 1,000 pre-orders. In a notable move, 
Friend.com purchased the domain name friend.com for $1.8 million, aiming to establish a strong brand presence 
Today in AI Friend's approach emphasizes building deeper, emotionally resonant 
relationships with users, distinguishing itself from other AI companions by focusing 
on genuine companionship rather than productivity or entertainment. The company 
envisions its product as a supplement to human connection, not a replacement</p>
