    <h2>Entry #2 – Friend.com</h2>

    <p>
      Friend.com is an AI startup founded by Avi Schiffmann, known for creating a COVID-19 tracking website.
      The company has developed a wearable AI companion designed to combat loneliness by providing emotional support. The device, resembling a pendant,
      is worn around the neck and continuously listens to the user's environment. It connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth and uses the Claude 3.5 language
      model to offer real-time, personalized interactions. The device can respond to voice prompts and also proactively engage with users based on contextual cues.
      Priced at $99, the Friend pendant boasts a 15-hour battery life and comes in various colors. It is set to ship in January 2025. The company has already received over 1,000 pre-orders.
